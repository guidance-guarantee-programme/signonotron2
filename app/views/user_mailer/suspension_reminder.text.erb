Your <%= t('department.name') %> Signon <%= account_name %>, for <%= @user.email %>, will be suspended <%= suspension_time %>. After suspension you won't be able to access any <%= t('department.name') %> <%= account_name %> applications, eg Whitehall Publisher or Licensing.

<% if instance_name.present? %>
<%= account_name.humanize %> suspensions do not suspend production accounts or remove access to <%= t('department.name') %> production applications.
