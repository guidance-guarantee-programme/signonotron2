Hello <%= @user.name %>,

A Signon administrator has changed your Pension Wise Signon <%= account_name %> email from <%= @email_was %> to <%= @user.email %>.

You will now need to sign in using your new email <%= @user.email %>.

If your email address shouldn't have changed you should contact your line manager.

All the best,

The Pension Wise team
